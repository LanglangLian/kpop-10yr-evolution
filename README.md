# kpop-mv-growth-forecasting
Forecasting the 24-hour performance of newly released K-pop music videos using YouTube metadata, early engagement signals, and time-series modeling.

## Project Overview
This project builds a data science pipeline to analyze the early performance of K-pop MVs.
Using metadata + time-series engagement data (views/likes/comments) collected in the first minutes after release, the model predicts:
· 24-hour view count
· Whether the MV will surpass specific milestones (e.g., 10M views)
· The overall growth curve category (hit / normal / slow)

## Project Question
Is it possible to detect “potential viral MVs” shortly after release?
